            <p>Hello everyone. I am Aries Jake R. Rafisura but you can call me Jake for short. I am from General Santos City, Philippines. Me and my wife Michelle had been blessed with 3 lovely girls with ages 9, 6, & 2 years old. I love to watch movies, listening to music, play computer games and listen to podcasts. My favorite outdoor activities are hiking and swimming in the beach with my family. I am currently employed in a banking industry. I served my mission in Philippines Baguio Mission and right now I am serving in our ward as a clerk. I am looking foward to learning great thing in this course. Though I find the course a bit challenging, I am still excited to discover and learn new things. For me technology is a blessing and I want to use it on my advantage and bless my family and others with it.
